# Database Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a plan to analyze database tests and extract universal testing patterns that can be applied to any database schema, regardless of the specific business domain.

## Core Testing Patterns to Extract

### 1. Schema Validation Patterns
- [x] Basic Schema Testing (tables, columns, constraints)
- [x] Advanced Schema Validation (dynamic checks, metadata)
- [x] Data Type Constraints
- [ ] Foreign Key Relationships
- [ ] Index Usage and Performance

### 2. Access Control Patterns
- [x] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [x] Row-Level Security (RLS)
- [x] Permission Inheritance
- [ ] Multi-tenant Isolation
- [ ] Object Ownership Models

### 3. Data Integrity Patterns
- [ ] Constraint Enforcement
- [ ] Trigger Validation
- [ ] Computed Column Testing
- [ ] Cascading Operations
- [ ] Transaction Boundaries

### 4. State Management Patterns
- [x] State Transitions
- [x] State-Based Permissions
- [ ] State History Tracking
- [ ] State Machine Validation
- [ ] Concurrent State Changes

### 5. Relationship Testing Patterns
- [ ] One-to-One Relationships
- [ ] One-to-Many Relationships
- [ ] Many-to-Many Relationships
- [ ] Hierarchical Structures
- [ ] Circular References

### 6. Identifier Management Patterns
- [x] Unique Identifier Generation
- [x] Collision Handling
- [ ] Custom Identifier Formats
- [ ] Scoped Uniqueness
- [ ] Identifier Stability

### 7. Resource Lifecycle Patterns
- [x] Resource Creation
- [x] Resource Updates
- [x] Resource Deletion
- [ ] Resource Versioning
- [ ] Resource Recovery

### 8. Policy Testing Patterns
- [x] Policy Creation
- [x] Policy Enforcement
- [ ] Policy Inheritance
- [ ] Policy Combinations
- [ ] Policy Overrides

## Progress Summary
- Completed analysis of basic schema validation patterns
- Documented core access control patterns
- Extracted state management patterns
- Identified resource lifecycle patterns

## Next Steps
1. Complete analysis of remaining core patterns
2. Document universal testing approaches for each pattern
3. Create reusable test templates
4. Develop pattern implementation guidelines
