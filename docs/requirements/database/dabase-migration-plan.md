# Database Migration Plan: Current Status and Next Steps

## Migration Progress Checklist

### âœ… Completed Tasks
- [x] Create initial trucking schema
- [x] Implement core tables: 
  * carriers
  * loads
  * invoices
  * audit_logs
- [x] Resolve migration sequence conflicts

### ðŸ”² Pending Tasks
- [ ] Implement Row Level Security (RLS) for trucking tables
- [ ] Add missing domain entities:
  * [ ] drivers
  * [ ] vehicles
  * [ ] contacts
  * [ ] factoring_companies
- [ ] Create comprehensive test data migration
- [ ] Generate updated TypeScript types

## Migration Challenges Resolved
- **Issue**: Conflicting migration sequences preventing table creation
- **Solution**: 
  * Created a new comprehensive migration file `20241208233158_trucking_schema_setup.sql`
  * Removed deprecated migration files
  * Established correct table creation order
- **Technical Details**:
  * Used `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` to prevent duplicate table creation
  * Implemented foreign key references with careful dependency management
  * Added performance-oriented indexes

## Current Schema Status

### Trucking Domain Schema
As of the latest migration, the following tables have been successfully created in the `trucking` schema:

1. **carriers**
   - Tracks trucking carrier information
   - Linked to `public.accounts` via `account_id`
   - Supports factoring company associations

2. **loads**
   - Represents freight loads
   - Linked to `public.accounts` and `trucking.carriers`
   - Tracks load status and timestamps

3. **invoices**
   - Manages invoices associated with loads and carriers
   - Linked to `public.accounts`, `trucking.loads`, and `trucking.carriers`
   - Supports various invoice statuses and payment tracking

4. **audit_logs**
   - Provides change tracking for trucking-related entities

## Pending Technical Implementations

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS)
- Implement comprehensive RLS policies for:
  * carriers
  * loads
  * invoices
- Ensure proper access controls based on account memberships

### 2. Additional Domain Entities
Implement remaining entities from the DBML diagram:
- `drivers`
- `vehicles`
- `contacts`
- `factoring_companies`

### 3. Data Validation and Constraints
- Review and enhance table constraints
- Add more specific check constraints
- Implement domain-specific validation rules

## Recommended Workflow
1. Implement missing domain entities
2. Add RLS policies
3. Create test data migration
4. Generate TypeScript types
5. Validate schema through end-to-end tests

## Tools and Commands
```bash
# Apply migrations
pnpm run supabase:web:reset

# Generate types
pnpm run supabase:web:typegen
```

## Potential Risks and Mitigations
- Schema changes may require data migration strategies
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Thoroughly test database interactions

## Learning Insights
- Importance of careful migration sequencing
- Benefits of using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- Significance of foreign key and index management in complex schemas

### Database Reset and Cleanup

#### Reset Local Database
```bash
# Reset Supabase database to initial state
pnpm run supabase:web:reset
```
- Useful when making significant schema changes
- Clears all data in local database

### Debugging and Troubleshooting

#### Check Supabase Status
```bash
# Verify local Supabase services
pnpm run supabase:web:status
```

#### View Supabase Logs
```bash
# Display Supabase service logs
pnpm run --filter web supabase logs
```

### Best Practices

1. Always generate types after migration changes
2. Use migrations for schema evolution
3. Avoid direct database modifications
4. Test migrations in local environment before production

### Common Workflow

```bash
# Typical development workflow
1. Make schema changes
2. pnpm run --filter web supabase migrations new description_of_change
3. Edit the new migration file
4. pnpm run --filter web supabase migrations up
5. pnpm run supabase:web:typegen
```

### Production Considerations

- Migrations are version-controlled
- Use `supabase migrations push` for production deployments
- Always backup production database before migrations

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Conflicts
- Resolve conflicts manually in migration files
- Ensure linear migration history
- Use meaningful, descriptive migration names

### Type Generation Issues
- Regenerate types after each schema change
- Check for compilation errors
- Verify Supabase CLI and project configuration

## Security Notes

- Never commit sensitive credentials
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Limit database access permissions
