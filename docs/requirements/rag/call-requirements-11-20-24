# Summary
Figma - CH Commander Discovery - 20 November 2024
Overview
The meeting focused on scoping and refining the CH Commander project, discussing requirements, potential scope cuts, and budget considerations. The conversation aimed to align on priorities, streamline development, and ensure the project stays within budget.

Key Points Discussed
1. Project Challenges and Context
Client Frustration: Issues with client satisfaction on other projects were mentioned as a cautionary context.
Budget and Scope Concerns: Balancing tight budgets while delivering a meaningful MVP was emphasized.
2. Scope and Features Analysis
Core Features:
Focus on replicating essential functionalities of the existing application (e.g., load management, invoicing) with some improvements.
Activities like detailed view and logging, which don't exist in the current software, were flagged as candidates for scope reduction.
Simplification:
Many detailed or redundant views (e.g., activity logs for loads, carrier details) were identified for de-scoping.
Streamlining CRUD operations for contacts, carriers, and invoices.
Critical Additions:
Improvements to user and contact management.
Basic reporting functionalities (e.g., executive summary dashboards).
3. Development Approaches
Markdown Documentation: Discussion about using Markdown-driven design to document entities and workflows for efficient development.
AI and Tools: Exploring tools like ChatGPT for generating documentation and optimizing workflows.
Budget Optimizations:
Deciding on what could be handled manually (e.g., subscription management) versus automated within the software.
4. Budget and Cost Management
Estimation Adjustments:
After cutting non-critical scope, the project is within budget at ~$63,000.
Potential for additional savings if development is handled in-house.
Milestone Payments:
Concerns raised over milestone-based payments, especially tied to client-defined deliverables.
5. Reporting and Analytics
Reports were simplified to include only executive summaries and basic dashboards.
Non-critical reports like cash flow analysis were excluded.
6. Operational Efficiency
Alignment on using tools like Stripe for lightweight subscription management.
Keeping user experience lean and focused on the most impactful features.
Next Steps
Finalize scope and create a clear project brief that outlines in-scope and out-of-scope items.
Generate documentation for features and workflows using Markdown and AI-assisted tools.
Prepare a short video walkthrough of the scoped features to align all stakeholders.
Ensure clear communication and invoicing for hours spent on the scoping and adjustments.

00:00:03,329 --> 00:00:07,779
Okay. In this video, I'll be going over the flowchart for chcommander.

2
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:12,843
Specifically, I'll be calling out the things that Ryan has deemed as in scope

3
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:16,070
and the things that are not in scope. Um,

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,673
originally, uh, we were modeling the application out to have essentially a

5
00:00:20,674 --> 00:00:23,155
broker platform as well as a carrier platform.

6
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,718
You can see that the carrier platform has been descoped for the MVP.

7
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,431
Um, everything that you see here in red will be considered out of scope

8
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:34,983
for the purposes of the MVP. This includes some of the net new features

9
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:38,566
we were considering, like an activity log on load details,

10
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:42,488
um, similar functionality on contact details,

11
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,800
carrier details, factoring company details,

12
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:47,696
carrier quotes, and some reporting screens,

13
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:52,275
as well as messaging between carriers and brokers in-app and,

14
00:00:52,276 --> 00:00:55,081
uh, the carrier portal, as I mentioned. So,

15
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:58,143
orienting yourself to this flowchart if you were to ever look at it.

16
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:03,212
We have some features that were originally going to be shared between brokers and

17
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:05,861
carriers, like profile management, account management,

18
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:10,784
user management, and authentication. Features that are specific to brokers

19
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,270
and features that are specific to carriers. Because carriers have been de-scoped,

20
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:18,492
um, the distinction between the three doesn't,

21
00:01:18,493 --> 00:01:21,574
uh, matter. So, when you're looking at this flowchart,

22
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:23,776
you can just anticipate that, uh,

23
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:26,514
there is a set of features related to authentication,

24
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:31,239
and for the purposes of the MVP, that authentication is specifically related to it.

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,582
As we're going through this flowchart, there are certain shapes,

26
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:37,525
uh, that have meaning. I'm going to go over those shapes now.

27
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:39,846
Uh, the rectangle with the,

28
00:01:39,847 --> 00:01:42,068
uh, two lines, uh,

29
00:01:42,088 --> 00:01:46,741
crossed here are going to be representative of basically a container of things.

30
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:49,314
This could be a screen for a page,

31
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:53,656
an email, or a modal. If you ever see a rectangle without those two

32
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:58,380
lines, that will be representative of something that is on one of those screens.

33
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:01,321
page, email, or modal. This could be an email. It could It could be,

34
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:03,932
um, content. It could be a number of things.

35
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:06,532
Just otherwise, it's, uh, it's something on a page.

36
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:09,616
Whenever we see a diamond on the flowchart,

37
00:02:09,617 --> 00:02:11,936
this will be representative of a user action.

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,370
And whenever you see a rounded rectangle,

39
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:17,852
this will be representative of a condition.

40
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:21,634
Uh, if that thing is true, the thing below it would happen or would

41
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:25,657
show. And any time you see a circle,

42
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:29,890
this will be representative of either an end point in the user journey or

43
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:32,322
a hyperlink. To a different part of the flowchart.

44
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:35,724
So beginning with authentication,

45
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:38,706
just an easy way to orient ourselves onto this legend,

46
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,488
we'll kind of start in the middle of it with the login page.

47
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:44,229
This application will not have self-service sign up.

48
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,632
Uh, instead users will, tenants will be invited to join their,

49
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:52,075
uh, their own account, uh, by a super admin.

50
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:56,968
Meanwhile, users who already have access can go to a login page where there

51
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,030
will be inputs for email and password. If they've forgotten a password,

52
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:03,201
they can still select this action to take them to a forgot password page.

53
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,383
Otherwise they can log in and be redirected to the loads list.

54
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:10,597
If the user had forgotten their password, they'd be redirected to a forgot password

55
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:14,688
page where they can input their email, select the reset password action,

56
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:17,470
and they would receive an email for forgotten password.

57
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:20,964
You can see that email up here at the top. The email that they

58
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:24,955
would receive would provide some content about their forgotten password and an action for

59
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:29,619
resetting their password, taking them to a reset password page that has inputs for

60
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,992
setting the password in case confirming the password and confirming this,

61
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,834
this would then redirect them to the login page where they can log in

62
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:38,756
with their new password. Meanwhile,

63
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:41,327
if users are invited to a tenant's account,

64
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:44,600
uh, they would receive an email for accepting the invite.

65
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,203
The action for accepting the invite would take them to set their password and

66
00:03:49,283 --> 00:03:53,626
then they can log in. All right.

67
00:03:55,367 --> 00:04:00,640
After the user has logged in, they'd be redirected to a loads list view.

68
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,673
The loads list page would include a search,

69
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,683
a date range, a date range picker or a date picker,

70
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:08,455
uh, the ability to filter the loads list.

71
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:12,368
We are currently anticipating that users should be able to filter the loads list

72
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:14,459
by status, customer, carrier, shipper,

73
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,925
or factory and company. Any active filters would display on the page.

74
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:23,916
The loads list itself, as you can see here,

75
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:27,398
the list of loads in each item in the load would contain the details.

76
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,800
The details would include potentially the load number.

77
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:33,713
The recorder number potentially. The status,

78
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:36,204
carrier, ship date, delivery date, customer,

79
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:38,516
origin, and destination, just at the list view.

80
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:42,718
At any time a user should be able from the loads list page to

81
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:45,250
create a new load. This would open up a modal,

82
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:49,002
uh, where these inputs on the right side here would display.

83
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:51,944
This includes all the load details, including the load number,

84
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:54,376
who you're billing, dispatchers, sales rep, status,

85
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,777
uh, work order, pick up time, delivery time,

86
00:04:56,778 --> 00:04:59,359
PO number, etc. Uh,

87
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:01,771
there would be carrier details. sales is sort of, should select for the carrier,

88
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:04,432
driver equipment type, uh, the carrier fee,

89
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:07,765
the currency, the shipper details at the shipper location,

90
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,066
date, range, description type, quantity, value,

91
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,728
notes, and PO number, and any consignee details.

92
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,809
Um, there can be one or many,

93
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,851
uh, consignees and shippers,

94
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:19,793
so this would be done in a repeater pattern. Those are all of the

95
00:05:19,794 --> 00:05:22,695
inputs that would be required to create a new load.

96
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:27,158
And out of scope would be the details related to,

97
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:30,470
um, a load in a specific load detail screen.

98
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:35,072
This is, um, more or less in its initial state going to model how

99
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:38,595
the current truck stop application works, where if I want to view a load,

100
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:41,427
I just view it from the, uh,

101
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:44,549
the manage modal, where I see all the inputs in a,

102
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,741
uh, editable way. In a future state,

103
00:05:47,742 --> 00:05:50,573
you would have a details view that would show all of these,

104
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:53,856
uh, details as a read-only value that can be edited,

105
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:57,478
as well as an activity log, where we would be able to see any

106
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,539
status update that has occurred,

107
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,881
um, on, uh, particular load,

108
00:06:01,882 --> 00:06:06,384
such as the, uh, BOL being signed or a carrier

109
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:10,027
update and essentially having a timeline or new speed of everything that has happened.

110
00:06:12,627 --> 00:06:14,779
Okay, moving on from load's list,

111
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,291
we have contact management. Uh,

112
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:20,533
we've simplified the data model a little bit from how truck stop does these

113
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:23,855
things. If you look at the information architecture,

114
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:28,855
um,

115
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,540
specifically the ERD, uh, we have contacts and contacts can

116
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:38,780
be customers, shippers, or consignees and we are modeling it like this because a

117
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:41,000
shipper can sometimes be, uh,

118
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,440
in some cases be a customer or in other cases be a consignee.

119
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,180
Um, so just modeling this in a way that's flexible.

120
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:52,140
So, um, more or less we have contact management

121
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:56,280
and then a contact can be represented as one or many things and in

122
00:06:56,281 --> 00:07:00,800
different loads. So in this contact list we of course

123
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:04,487
have a . Search and filter currently anticipating that we can filter by status,

124
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:07,024
contact type such as customer, consignee,

125
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:09,070
or shipper, and factoring company.

126
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:12,528
The contact list would include the company name,

127
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:14,849
the address, the city, the name, state telephone.

128
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,276
We'll go ahead and add contact name in there as well.

129
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:21,198
Go ahead and do contact type.

130
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:28,128
And a user can add a new contact at any time.

131
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:31,010
These are the current inputs required to create a new contact.

132
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:34,242
We have. Things like the name, the contact type, and it's a multi-select here.

133
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:36,797
Um, any internal notes, federal ID,

134
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:39,686
if they're blacklisted, if they're a broker, workers' comp number,

135
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:42,087
or their website, they're mailing address, they're billing address,

136
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:44,349
uh, any contacts, um,

137
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:46,730
whoever the primary contact is going to be,

138
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:49,072
uh, finances, uh,

139
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:52,214
related details and, um,

140
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:56,677
quote settings as well. The details for you for this has been descoped,

141
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:59,509
but otherwise it would provide a new speed of all the activity that has

142
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,772
happened related to that particular contact.

143
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:06,443
Um, it would show the related loads associated to that contact and the related

144
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,545
invoices associated to that contact.

145
00:08:08,546 --> 00:08:13,198
Um, it also show a read-only view of the contact's information with

146
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,050
the ability to edit it and the ability to send emails from here.

147
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:22,694
Next is carrier management. So similar to the other list

148
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:24,746
views, we have the ability of searching and filtering,

149
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:28,608
a filtering for carriers. The carrier list would show the company name,

150
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:31,540
the address, city, state, zip, and phone. We'll you in one. the other.

151
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,720
the ability of creating a new carrier at any time.

152
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,520
These are the details that would be related to creating a carrier.

153
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,240
These details include the carrier name, storage address,

154
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,060
city, state, zip, uh, DOT, number,

155
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,100
any contacts and repeat or fashion, the ability to set a primary contact and

156
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:48,820
the ability to set an accounting contact, uh,

157
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,880
finances, uh, this carrier portal is descoped,

158
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,860
uh, any insurance-related information,

159
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,400
like the liability company, the auto insurance company,

160
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,720
the cargo company, uh, et cetera,

161
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,863
and their equipment as well. Um, . Being able to set their equipment.

162
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:05,204
The details view of this has been descoped,

163
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:07,864
and similar to the other views, uh, this would be,

164
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:09,946
uh, the ability to,

165
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:12,157
uh, see the activity log, the loads list,

166
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:15,870
the invoice list, and the carrier list. I've made this particular section green because

167
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:17,991
we will still need a driver's list,

168
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:20,152
so this is not descoped. Um,

169
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:22,174
it would just be another, uh, list view,

170
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,197
like carrier list, but it would just be for drivers.

171
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:26,999
And drivers can be associated to carriers.

172
00:09:29,197 --> 00:09:31,360
All right. Uh, moving on, factoring company,

173
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:33,962
uh, a list view of these,

174
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:36,103
uh, administrative, uh, things such as,

175
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:40,666
uh, search and filter the factory company list would have

176
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,702
the company name, address city, state, and zip.

177
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:45,679
And in order to create a new factoring company,

178
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,932
we would provide these details. The ability to have one or many contacts and

179
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:54,210
the ability to, uh, manage the finance settings of the factoring company.

180
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:58,318
The details view of the factoring company,

181
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:00,659
uh, has been descoped. Good.

182
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,820
This would just include the activity log and then associated loads and voices and

183
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:09,840
carriers. Um, all that information is available,

184
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,360
of course, and this is true for all of the entities.

185
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,780
In the manage modal, this would just be the ability to,

186
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,280
um, see the records associated in an easy place.

187
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,340
Alright. Moving on from the administrative,

188
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:29,120
um, entity management. There are two different

189
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:31,180
invoice screens. Essentially, we have,

190
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:35,463
uh, . Our accounts receivable screen and we have our accounts payable screen in

191
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:38,585
truck stop today. I believe this is called like the accounting manager and then

192
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:40,706
the carrier pay manager. Um,

193
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:44,106
so anyway, we have an invoice list view for accounts receivable.

194
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,730
We would have the ability of searching searching and filtering,

195
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:51,293
uh, invoices. We would have a list view of those invoices and

196
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:54,445
we would be able to see the associated low number of each invoice,

197
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,815
the shipping date, the customer, the carrier,

198
00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:00,479
the driver, and the status. The status is either ready to invoice invoice or

199
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,147
paid. at any point. We can mark an invoice as paid.

200
00:11:04,657 --> 00:11:06,893
We can, uh, if the invoice exists,

201
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:09,845
we can download it. If the invoice does not exist yet,

202
00:11:09,846 --> 00:11:12,417
uh, for the load in the list here,

203
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:15,839
we can send the invoice. It opens up a modal where we can put

204
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,091
in the email, uh, for, uh,

205
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,958
sending the, uh, the invoice and shipping it.

206
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:26,847
And we can do this in bulk as well. In the carrier payer,

207
00:11:26,848 --> 00:11:30,669
the carrier invoices, the accounts payable. We do also have search and filter anticipated.

208
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,621
We also We'll see you also have the invoice list.

209
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:38,121
Uh, this would be the columns we're anticipating in that list view,

210
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,426
load number, carrier, customer, etc. Uh,

211
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:46,030
most importantly is aging. And if the invoice does not

212
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:50,593
exist, we can send the invoice. Um,

213
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:53,605
that might be the invoice received would be actually the,

214
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:56,737
the language. Uh,

215
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,039
if the invoice has been received, then we can input the details of the

216
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,001
invoice here, like whether or not it matters. They agreed amount.

217
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:05,102
Um,

218
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:07,784
these other invoices, like the load number, carrier details,

219
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:11,373
uh, would be available here. And we can submit this to update the status.

220
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,948
The status is either ready to receive, received,

221
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:16,370
or paid. If the invoice has been received,

222
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:19,111
we can download the pay report or un-receive the bill if we've made a

223
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:23,354
mistake here. We can also do a bulk action to receive many invoices.

224
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:26,637
Um,

225
00:12:26,657 --> 00:12:31,260
everything related to creating carrier quotes and sending that to carriers and carrier

226
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:33,560
portal has been received. And the scope, so I'm not going to go over

227
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:37,900
that during this video. There would be a billing page where the tenants,

228
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,580
the subscriber to the software, would have the ability of seeing potentially their

229
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:45,180
subscription tiers if there are any. Um,

230
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,820
if this were to become a self service model,

231
00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:50,080
this is modeled here to show that they can,

232
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:54,520
um, subscribe to higher level plans or downgrade.

233
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,880
If that were not true, minimally what they would need is a billing table

234
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:02,020
where they'd be able to see previous invoices. .

235
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:05,480
. . and the ability to manage their credit card. Uh,

236
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:10,000
the reports that are going to be included

237
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:14,040
in the MVP are essentially the same reports that are included in TruckStop,

238
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,380
uh, currently calling this the executive summary report page.

239
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,160
And it just includes things like metrics, cars related to open loads,

240
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,720
net margin, gross revenue, truck miles and load volume.

241
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,220
It would include a table related to the sales rep leaderboard,

242
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,220
show line graphs for revenue over time,

243
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,632
and loads over time. . And bar charts for miles by carrier and load

244
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:38,033
volume by carrier. There are additional,

245
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:42,170
uh, reports that would be anticipated in a future state of the application.

246
00:13:42,242 --> 00:13:44,858
I won't go over those now, but you can see them here.

247
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:48,641
Um, all of the metric cards, all the tables that would be anticipated in

248
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:53,884
all of the line graphs as well. Okay,

249
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:56,156
um, finishing this off,

250
00:13:56,157 --> 00:13:58,387
I go in over user management profile and accounting.

251
00:13:58,388 --> 00:14:01,580
Um, a tenant should be able to add one or many users.

252
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,013
To their account. So this would be on a user page where there would

253
00:14:06,014 --> 00:14:10,285
be search and filter. Um, also the ability to see users on the account.

254
00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:14,040
Uh, we'd be able to see the name, email status role and the type,

255
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:17,762
like whether or not they are a sales person, a dispatcher or a tracker.

256
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,705
And we would have the ability of inviting a user to our tenant.

257
00:14:25,043 --> 00:14:29,198
There would be a profile page where every user within the tenant can manage

258
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,410
their own profile. This includes password management,

259
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:33,641
notification. And then,

260
00:14:33,642 --> 00:14:36,124
uh, regular input, such as their name and their email.

261
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:39,806
And there would be an account settings level, uh,

262
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:42,918
account settings page that is available to admins.

263
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:45,750
And this would be the ability to update the tenant information,

264
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,782
like the company name, street address, city, state,

265
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:51,235
zip, currency and net terms. Okay.

266
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:54,738
Uh, that is it for the scope of CH Commander.

267
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:57,590
Please let me know if you have any questions and I'm happy to help.

268
00:14:57,591 --> 00:14:58,100
Thanks.
