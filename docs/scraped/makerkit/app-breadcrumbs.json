It's designed to work with Next.js and uses the usePathname hook from Next.js for routing information.FeaturesAutomatically generates breadcrumbs from the current URL pathSupports custom labels for path segmentsLimits the number of displayed breadcrumbs with an ellipsis for long pathsInternationalization support with the Trans componentResponsive design with different text sizes for mobile and desktopUsageimport { AppBreadcrumbs } from '@kit/ui/app-breadcrumbs';function MyPage() {  return (    <AppBreadcrumbs      values={{        \"custom-slug\": \"Custom Label\"      }}      maxDepth={4}    />  );}When you have IDs in your URL, you can use the values prop to provide custom labels for those segments. For example, if your URL is /users/123, you can set values={{ \"123\": \"User Profile\" }} to display \"User Profile\" instead of \"123\" in the breadcrumb.<AppBreadcrumbs  values={{    \"123\": \"User\"  }}/>This will display \"User\" instead of \"123\" in the breadcrumb.PropsThe component accepts two optional props:values: An object where keys are URL segments and values are custom labels.Type: Record<string, string>Default: {}maxDepth: The maximum number of breadcrumb items to display before using an ellipsis.Type: numberDefault: 6FunctionalityThe component splits the current path into segments and creates a breadcrumb item for each.If the number of segments exceeds maxDepth, it shows an ellipsis (...) to indicate hidden segments.The last breadcrumb item is not clickable and represents the current page.Custom labels can be provided through the values prop.For segments without custom labels, it attempts to use an i18n key (common.routes.[unslugified-path]). If no translation is found, it falls back to the unslugified path.StylingThe component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling.Breadcrumb items are capitalized.On larger screens (lg breakpoint), the text size is slightly smaller.DependenciesThis component relies on several other components and utilities:Next.js usePathname hookCustom UI components (Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem, etc.) from Shadcn UIIf component for conditional renderingTrans component for internationalizationThis component provides a flexible and easy-to-use solution for adding breadcrumb navigation to your Next.js application. It's particularly useful for sites with deep hierarchical structures or those requiring dynamic breadcrumb generation."
