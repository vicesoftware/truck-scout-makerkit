This is a quick starting point that will start turning Makerkit into your very own app.Database: Drawing and writing the database schema. Of course, your app will store data and have its schema. It's time to draw it.Routing: Adding new routes. Your new pages will need routes - unless you can reuse the \"home\" pages of the accounts.Fetching Data: Fetching data from your DB and displaying it onto the new routes.Writing Data Adding new forms. You will need to add forms to create new data.In 90% of cases, the above is what you will be doing. The remaining 10% is adding new (very specific) features, which are a bit more complex - and not relevant to Makerkit itself."
