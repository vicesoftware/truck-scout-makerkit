You may need to adjust the path based on your project structure.Update the importsNB: you may need to update the imports to the cn utility function to use the relative imports because it somehow breaks. Please do that.Export the componentTo achieve optimal tree-shaking, we export each component individually using the exports field in the package.json file. This allows you to import the component directly from the package.Once the component has been created, you can export by adding a new export to the package.json file.We assume that the component is located at src/shadcn/avatar.tsx. To export the component, you can append a new export field to the exports map inside the package.json file:{  \"exports\": {    \"./avatar\": \"./src/shadcn/avatar.tsx\"  }}Now you can import it directly from the package:import { Avatar } from '@kit/ui/avatar';NB: this is an example, you need to adjust the component name based on the component you are exporting."
