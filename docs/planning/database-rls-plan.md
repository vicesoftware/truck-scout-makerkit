# RLS Implementation Plan for TruckingApp

This document outlines the tasks and responsibilities for implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) in the TruckingApp database schema, starting with the invoices system as our test entity.

---

## **1. Objectives and Scope**
- **Objective**: Protect sensitive data by enforcing granular, role-based access control at the database level.
- **Initial Scope**: Implement RLS for the invoices system as a test case:
  - Secure the `trucking.invoices` table
  - Implement role-based access control
  - Use this implementation to validate patterns for broader RLS rollout

---

## **2. Tasks and Responsibilities**

### **Custom GPT (Domain Knowledge and Requirements Expertise)**
Tasks focused on planning, requirements gathering, and stakeholder alignment.

- [x] **Define RLS Objectives and Scope**:
  - Document tables and columns that require RLS.
  - Focus on invoices system for initial implementation.
  - ✓ Completed in [invoice-rls-scope.md](../requirements/database/invoice-rls-scope.md)

- [x] **Plan Invoice RLS Functions**:
  - ✓ Defined core functions and invoice-specific functions
  - ✓ Completed in [rls-functions-req.md](../requirements/database/rls-functions-req.md)

- [x] **Write Invoice Policy Blueprints**:
  - ✓ Created policies for invoices table
  - ✓ Created policies for invoice access
  - ✓ Completed in [RLS_Policy_Blueprints.md](../requirements/database/RLS_Policy_Blueprints.md)

- [x] **Document Invoice-Specific Business Rules**:
  - ✓ Defined access control rules
  - ✓ Specified status management
  - ✓ Outlined security requirements
  - ✓ Completed in [invoice-business-rules.md](../requirements/database/invoice-business-rules.md)

- [ ] **Validate Requirements**:
  - Test edge cases specific to invoice workflows
  - Verify factoring company access patterns
  - See detailed plan in [rls_validation_task_list_plan.md](./rls_validation_task_list_plan.md)

### **Cline (Code-Level Implementation and Debugging)**
Tasks focused on implementing the invoice system security following the tutorial pattern.

- [ ] **Create Initial Migration**:
  ```sql
  -- Following tutorial's pattern for schema changes
  pnpm --filter web supabase migration new invoice-system
  ```

- [ ] **Implement RLS Functions**:
  - Implement core and invoice-specific functions
  - Add validation logic
  - Set up access controls

- [ ] **Configure Invoice Permissions**:
  ```sql
  -- Following tutorial's permission pattern
  alter type public.app_permissions add value 'invoices.update';
  alter type public.app_permissions add value 'invoices.delete';
  alter type public.app_permissions add value 'invoices.status';
  ```

- [ ] **Set Up Initial Migrations**:
  - Create migration for invoice security
  - Add RLS policies
  - Configure permissions

- [ ] **Implement Testing Framework**:
  - Unit tests for invoice access
  - Permission validation tests
  - Status management tests

### **Collaborative Tasks**
Tasks requiring iteration between Custom GPT and Cline.

- [ ] **Test Real-World Invoice Scenarios**:
  - Invoice creation and updates
  - Status transitions
  - Factoring company access

- [ ] **Document Implementation**:
  - Detail invoice security model
  - Document access patterns
  - Explain permission model
