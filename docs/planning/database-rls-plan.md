# RLS Implementation Plan for TruckingApp

This document outlines the tasks and responsibilities for implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) in the TruckingApp database schema. Tasks are divided between **Custom GPT** (domain knowledge and requirements expertise) and **Cline** (code-level implementation and debugging).

---

## **1. Objectives and Scope**
- **Objective**: Protect sensitive data by enforcing granular, role-based access control at the database level.
- **Scope**: Apply RLS to core entities in the `auth`, `public`, `trucking`, and `kit` schemas. Focus on:
  - Protecting user, account, and domain-specific data.
  - Enabling multi-tenancy and SaaS-specific access controls.

---

## **2. Tasks and Responsibilities**

### **Custom GPT (Domain Knowledge and Requirements Expertise)**
Tasks focused on planning, requirements gathering, and stakeholder alignment.

- [x] **Define RLS Objectives and Scope**:
  - Document tables and columns that require RLS.
  - Prioritize high-risk entities for initial implementation.

- [x] **Document Business Rules**:
  - Define ownership and access logic (e.g., `account_id` or `user_id` relationships).
  - Map roles (`Owner`, `Admin`, `Member`) to their permissions.

- [x] **Describe Access Scenarios**:
  - Example: "Owners can view and edit all loads for their account."
  - Draft user stories for validation.

- [x] **Plan RLS Functions**:
  - Specify reusable functions like `public.has_role_on_account`.

- [ ] **Write Policy Blueprints**:
  - Draft SQL-like pseudocode for policies (e.g., `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` operations).

- [ ] **Validate Requirements**:
  - Review edge cases, such as shared resources or cross-account data sharing.
  - Ensure alignment with business logic and user expectations.

- [ ] **Review RLS Implementation Proposals**:
  - Validate the alignment of implemented policies with the planned requirements.

---

### **Cline (Code-Level Implementation and Debugging)**
Tasks focused on writing, testing, and debugging SQL policies and database functions.

- [ ] **Write SQL RLS Policies**:
  - Translate policy blueprints into production-ready SQL.
  - Use `USING` and `WITH CHECK` clauses as required.

- [ ] **Implement Reusable Functions**:
  - Write PostgreSQL functions like `public.has_role_on_account`.
  - Ensure functions are optimized and secure.

- [ ] **Configure Permissions**:
  - Revoke default permissions (`REVOKE ALL`) and assign granular permissions (`GRANT`).

- [ ] **Set Up Initial Migrations**:
  - Create migration scripts for deploying RLS policies.
  - Test schema compatibility with policies.

- [ ] **Automate Testing for RLS**:
  - Write unit tests using tools like `pgTap` to validate policy behavior.
  - Ensure unauthorized users cannot access data.

- [ ] **Debug and Optimize SQL**:
  - Resolve issues in SQL-level implementations during testing.
  - Optimize queries for performance.

- [ ] **Implement Schema Updates**:
  - Add indexes or constraints as needed to support RLS.
  - Handle schema evolution (e.g., new columns or tables).

---

### **Collaborative Tasks**
Tasks requiring iterative collaboration between Custom GPT and Cline.

- [ ] **Design Ownership Logic**:
  - Finalize rules for data ownership (e.g., are `drivers` tied to `carriers` or `accounts`?).

- [ ] **Test Real-World Scenarios**:
  - Validate RLS policies using simulated user behavior for various roles.

- [ ] **Optimize Policy Logic**:
  - Review performance metrics and adjust policies as needed.

- [ ] **Handle Edge Cases**:
  - Collaborate to solve complex scenarios like cross-account resource sharing.

- [ ] **Document Policy Implementation**:
  - Annotate SQL scripts and maintain clear documentation.

## **3. Progress Tracking**

| **Task Type**         | **Owner**        | **Status**        | **Notes**                                   |
|------------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Define requirements    | Custom GPT       | Not Started       | Tailored to domain and stakeholder input.   |
| Draft policy blueprints| Custom GPT       | Not Started       | High-level logic and pseudocode.            |
| Implement SQL policies | Cline            | Not Started       | Translate plans into SQL and scripts.       |
| Debug RLS policies     | Cline            | Not Started       | Resolve errors in SQL-level implementation. |
| Validate edge cases    | Collaborative    | Not Started       | Align business rules with code behavior.    |

---

## **Next Steps**
1. Begin with **Custom GPT tasks** to define objectives, rules, and blueprints for `public.accounts`.
2. Transition to **Cline tasks** for implementing and testing the first set of policies.
3. Iterate through collaborative tasks to handle edge cases and optimize policy logic.
4. Expand RLS implementation to additional tables and schemas.
