# RLS Implementation Plan for TruckingApp

This document outlines the tasks and responsibilities for implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) in the TruckingApp database schema, starting with the invoices system as our test entity.

---

## **1. Objectives and Scope**
- **Objective**: Protect sensitive data by enforcing granular, role-based access control at the database level.
- **Initial Scope**: Implement RLS for the invoices system as a test case:
  - Secure the `trucking.invoices` table
  - Implement role-based access control
  - Use this implementation to validate patterns for broader RLS rollout

---

## **2. Remaining RLS Test Scenarios**

### **Comprehensive RLS Validation Roadmap**

1. **Completed Test Scenarios**
   - [x] Schema Validation

     * Status Validation Tests
       - Test paid invoice modification prevention

   - [ ] **Financial Data Protection Tests**
     * Sensitive Field Access Tests
       - Test amount visibility restrictions
       - Validate payment details access control
       - Verify internal notes visibility
     * Role-Based Data Access Tests
       - Test owner/billing full access
       - Verify admin masked data access
       - Validate member limited visibility
     * External Access Tests
       - Test factoring company data restrictions
       - Verify carrier-specific data access
       - Validate external user data masking

   - [ ] **Audit and Logging Tests**
     * Status Change Logging
       - Test audit trail creation
       - Verify log entry completeness
       - Validate log access controls
     * Data Modification Tracking
       - Test update logging
       - Verify user attribution
       - Validate timestamp accuracy

   - [ ] **Edge Cases and Security Tests**
     * Boundary Tests
       - Test null account references
       - Validate empty/invalid data handling
       - Test maximum value scenarios
     * Security Vector Tests
       - Test SQL injection prevention
       - Validate cross-account access attempts
       - Test permission elevation attempts

### **Test Implementation Strategy**

- **Incremental Development**
  - Build upon existing `invoice-rls-validation.spec.ts`
  - Create focused, single-purpose test cases
  - Ensure minimal and precise validation

- **Test Coverage Objectives**
  - 100% coverage of RLS access scenarios
  - Validate all potential security vectors
  - Minimize potential data exposure risks

---

## **3. Implementation Approach**

### **Test Scenario Development Workflow**
1. **Scenario Design**
   - Identify specific RLS validation requirements
   - Define clear, measurable test objectives
   - Create detailed test case specifications

2. **Implementation**
   - Develop Playwright test scripts
   - Use service role for comprehensive testing
   - Implement granular, focused test cases

3. **Validation**
   - Execute tests in controlled environment
   - Log and analyze test results
   - Iterate and refine test scenarios

---

## **4. Next Immediate Steps**

1. **Detailed Test Scenario Development**
   - Implement role-based access control tests (Admin, Billing, Member)
   - Develop status management validation suite
   - Create financial data protection test cases
   - Design audit logging validation tests

2. **Test Infrastructure Preparation**
   - Create test users for each role
   - Set up test data for various scenarios
   - Configure logging and monitoring
   - Prepare test environment isolation

3. **Continuous Validation**
   - Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
   - Establish regular security validation processes
   - Create documentation for RLS testing approach

---

## **5. Long-Term RLS Testing Strategy**

- Expand test scenarios to other sensitive tables
- Develop reusable RLS testing patterns
- Create comprehensive security validation framework
- Establish continuous security monitoring
